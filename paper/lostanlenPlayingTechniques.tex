\begin{abstract}
This article provides the first benchmark of machine listening techniques for the classification of extended playing techniques in the symphonic orchestra.
We identify three necessary conditions for significantly outperforming the MFCC baseline:
(1) the inclusion of second-order scattering coefficients to account for the presence of amplitude modulations ;
(2) the inclusion of large temporal scales ; and
(3) the resort to supervised metric learning.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}

The progressive diversification of the timbral palette in Western classical music at the turn of the 20th century is reflected in four concurrent trends:
the addition of new instruments to the Western symphonic instrumentarium, either by technological inventions (e.g. theremin) or importation from non-Western musical cultures (e.g. marimba) ;
the resort to novel instrumental associations, as epitomized by \emph{Klangfarbenmelodie} ;
the temporary alteration of
and a more systematic usage of extended instrumental techniques, such as snap pizzicato, col legno batutto, or flutter tonguing.
The first of these trends has now stalled: to this day, most Western composers rely on an acoustic instrumentarium that is only marginally different from the one that was available in the Late Romantic period.
%whereas few others took the radical stance of crafting their own acoustic instruments -- Harry Partch being a noteworthy exception.
Nevertheless, the latter two approaches to timbral diversification, namely polyphonic mixtures and extended instrumental techniques, were massively adopted into post-war contemporary music.



Far from being exclusive to Western classical music, extended playing techniques are also commonly found in the oral tradition.
In some cases, they even stand out as a distinctive component of musical style.
Four well-known examples are:
the snap pizzicato (``slap") of the upright bass in rockabilly,
the growl of the tenor saxophone in rock'n'roll,
the shuffle stroke of the violin (``fiddle'') in Irish folklore,
and the glissando of the clarinet in Klezmer music.
