\begin{abstract}
Although the automatic recognition of a musical instrument from the recording of a single ``ordinary'' note is close to becoming solved problem, the ability of a computer to precisely identify playing technique within an extended taxonomy remains far below human accuracy.
This article provides the first benchmark of machine listening systems for the classification of extended playing techniques in the symphonic orchestra.
We identify three necessary conditions for significantly outperforming the classical mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) baseline:
(1) the inclusion of second-order scattering coefficients to account for the presence of amplitude modulations ;
(2) the inclusion of large temporal scales ; and
(3) the resort to supervised metric learning.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
The progressive diversification of the timbral palette in Western classical music at the turn of the 20th century is reflected in five concurrent trends:
the addition of new instruments to the Western symphonic instrumentarium, either by technological inventions (\eg theremin) or importation from non-Western musical cultures (\eg marimba) \cite{sachs2012book};
the creation of novel instrumental associations, as epitomized by \emph{Klangfarbenmelodie} \cite{schoenberg2010book};
the temporary alteration of resonant properties through mutes and other ``preparations'' \cite{dianova2007phd};
a more systematic usage of extended instrumental techniques, such as artificial harmonics, \emph{col legno batutto}, or flutter tonguing \cite{kostka2016book};
and the resort to digital audio effects \cite{zolzer2011dafx}.
The first of these trends has somewhat stalled: to this day, most Western composers rely on an acoustic instrumentarium that is only marginally different from the one that was available in the Late Romantic period.
Nevertheless, the latter approaches to timbral diversification were massively adopted into post-war contemporary music.
In particular, an increased concern for the concept of musical gesture \cite{godoy2009book} has liberated many unconventional instrumental techniques from their figurativistic connotations, thus making the so-called ``ordinary'' playing style merely one of many compositional options.


Far from being exclusive to erudite music, extended playing techniques are also commonly found in oral tradition; in some cases, they even stand out as a distinctive component of musical style.
Four well-known examples are:
the snap pizzicato (``slap") of the upright bass in rockabilly,
the growl of the tenor saxophone in rock'n'roll,
the shuffle stroke of the violin (``fiddle'') in Irish folklore,
and the glissando of the clarinet in Klezmer music.
Consequently, the mere knowledge of organology (the \emph{what?} of instrumental music), as opposed to chironomics (the \emph{how?}), is a rather weak source of information for browsing and recommending music within large databases.

Yet, current research in music information retrieval (MIR) too rarely accounts for the diversity of

\section{Tasks}

Datasets of monophonic instrumental recordings are difficult to design, because most of the commercially available music is polyphonic.It appears that the Western tradition of solo music is essentially restricted to a narrow scope of instruments (piano, classical guitar, violin), and genres (sonatas, contemporary, free jazz, folk).
Without a careful curation of the musical data, undesirable correlations between instrument and genre appear.
