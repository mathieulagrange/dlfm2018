Ref: mfcc cut stand

Challenger: scat 25, median, log 

evaluate the frame size by considering an octave split

mfcc expand +1 

rand same scat 8, lmnn +1

octave much better for scat, worst for mfcc even in full band

faire une detection de silence ?

% This is short introduction to describe the main component of your
% experiment.

% Please have a look at the Config file. It allows you to set the general
% configuration parameters.

% Next, please have a look at the Factors file. It allows you to set the
% specific parameters that need to be set and tested for every
% configurations of your algorithm under evaluation.
